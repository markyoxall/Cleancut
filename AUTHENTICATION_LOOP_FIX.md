# ?? Authentication Loop Fix Summary

## ? **Problem Identified:**
From the output logs, we detected an **infinite authentication loop** where:
- IdentityServer was providing access tokens
- But `context.Principal` was null during `OnTokenResponseReceived` 
- This prevented tokens from being stored in claims
- Causing continuous redirects to IdentityServer

## ?? **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Removed Manual Token Claim Handling**
- Removed custom `ClaimActions.MapJsonKey()` calls
- Removed manual token addition in `OnTokenResponseReceived`  
- Let `SaveTokens = true` handle token storage automatically

### **2. Simplified API Service Authentication**
- Reverted to using `HttpContextAccessor.GetTokenAsync("access_token")`
- This works properly with `SaveTokens = true` in Blazor Server
- Removed `AuthenticationStateProvider` approach that was causing issues

### **3. Enhanced Logging**
- Added better debugging information
- Token length logging to verify tokens are received
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## ?? **Next Steps:**

1. **Restart the Blazor app** (important - configuration changes)
2. **Clear browser cookies/cache** for a fresh start
3. **Test the authentication flow**:
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:7297`
   - Should redirect to IdentityServer only once
   - Complete login and return to app
   - Dashboard should load with data

## ?? **Expected Result:**
- **No more authentication loops**
- **Successful token storage**
- **Working API calls with authentication**
- **Functional dashboard and data loading**

The authentication should now work properly for your Blazor Server application! ??
