# CleanCut WinForms App - Fixed Issues

## ? **Issues Resolved**

The WinForms app (`CleanCut.WinApp`) has been updated to match the "User" ? "Customer" terminology changes made throughout the application.

### **Fixed Components:**

#### **1. IProductListView Interface**
- ? Changed `ViewProductsByUserRequested` ? `ViewProductsByCustomerRequested`
- ? Changed `SetAvailableUsers()` ? `SetAvailableCustomers()`
- ? Updated parameter names to use "customers" instead of "users"

#### **2. ProductEditForm**
- ? Added `SetAvailableCustomers()` method that delegates to existing `SetAvailableUsers()`
- ? Maintains backward compatibility with existing UI controls
- ? Presenter can now call the expected method name

#### **3. ProductListForm**
- ? Updated event declarations to use `ViewProductsByCustomerRequested`
- ? Added `SetAvailableCustomers()` method that delegates to existing `SetAvailableUsers()`
- ? Event handlers work correctly with new naming convention

### **Architecture Benefits:**

#### **Direct Database Access** ?
- WinForms app uses **direct database access** via Clean Architecture
- No authentication needed since it bypasses the API entirely
- Uses `IUnitOfWork`, `ICustomerRepository`, `IProductRepository` with MediatR
- Faster performance due to direct data access

#### **MVP Pattern Maintained** ?
- Proper separation between View, Presenter, and Model
- Interface contracts maintained and updated
- Event-driven communication between components

### **Status Summary:**

- ? **Build**: Successfully compiles without errors
- ? **Interfaces**: All interface contracts satisfied
- ? **Terminology**: Updated to use "Customer" instead of "User"
- ? **Compatibility**: Maintains existing functionality
- ? **Architecture**: Clean Architecture principles preserved

### **How It Works:**

```
WinForms App ? Presenters ? MediatR ? Application Layer ? Domain Layer ? Database
```

The WinForms app has **no authentication dependencies** because it accesses the database directly through the Clean Architecture layers, making it simpler and faster than the web applications that need to go through the API.

### **Ready to Use:**

The WinForms app should now run correctly with the same data as your other applications, using the updated Customer terminology throughout the user interface.

**The WinForms app is now fully compatible and ready for testing!** ??
